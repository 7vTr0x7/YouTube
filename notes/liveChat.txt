        -> Web socket ( UI <-------> Server )
           - UI and connect with each and can send data to each other
           - initial connection takes time 
           - once connection is established we can send data in any direction and whenever we want to
           - there is no regular interval ( data can come in anytime it can take 1min,2mins or 10mins )
           - ex. trading apps, whats app

        -> API Polling  ( UI <------- Server )
           - Data is uni-directional 
           - UI will keep polling data after interval ( 1sec or 10sec )
           - on every interval ( 1sec or 10sec ) it check if data has came or not
