    - typing slow - 200ms
    - typing fast - 30ms

    - performance
       - iphone pro max -> 14 latter (14 API calls) * 1000 user = 14000 api calls
       - with debouncing -> 3 API calls * 1000 user = 3000 API calls


    - Debouncing with 200ms
      - if difference between 2 key strokes is < 200ms -> decline api call
      - if > 200ms make an api call
