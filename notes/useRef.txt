    - useRef is a react hook that lets you reference a value that's not needed rendering

    - It is used to store a value in value that we don't want to render

    - useRef helps us to store the value that we don't want to be reset because of re-render
      - components are JS functions that return a JSX 
        - on every render these functions are new ( because they get destroyed from execution context )
          - because of this normal variables are reset 
    - To prevent this reset of variable and store its value or make its value persistent even after re-render we use useRef
